## Overview

The **Henon Series Predictor** application allows users to:
- Generate the first 500 values of the Henon series and graph Yn as a function of Xn.
- Visualize the architecture for Takens Algorithm.
- Experiment with network learning by adjusting the number of hidden units.
- Make predictions based on previously trained networks.

## Features

- **Generate Henon Series**: Calculates and graphs the first 500 values.
- **Takens Algorithm**: Allows visualization of the Takens embedding technique and eigenvalue analysis.
- **Network Learning**: Simulates network learning based on the number of hidden units.
- **Predictions**: Displays predictions of future values based on the trained network.
